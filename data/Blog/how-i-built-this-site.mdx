# Overview


When I decided that I wanted my own space on the internet, I really wanted it to be an outlet of my thoughts or just a place where I could store my notes and observations. Now I am not a web developer, nor am I too enthusiastic about building a very complex portfolio website. However, I do like a level of freedom whenever I work with any software. This is why, I decided to power all my blogs with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com).

## What is MDX?

Yet another Javascript library? Well, yes, but quite a novel one. I have personally found Markdown a very convenient and expressive way of quickly writing any documentation. MDX allows me to write Markdown __and__ integrate JSX/TSX components within it. That's the level of freedom that really appeals to me :D. 

AAAA

## How do I use it with in this website?

My website is currently powered by NextJS and TailwindCSS. To make the process of writing blogs simpler, I write them all in Markdown. Now, when I build my website (`next build`), `next` reads the MDX and passes it to a library called `next-mdx-remote`. This renders my blog's content to actual HTML, along with any styling that I provide. 

That's it! Now every time I need to create a new blog, I just write down a new MDX file and I am done.
